# Arduino_light_gate

Wire up the circuit as shown in the picture, each resistor is 220 ohm, by expanding the setup you can easiy create a thing to measure the speed of a moving object between two light gates using a software timer

# You will need:
- An Arduino board with a USB cable
- A bread board
- 3 220Î© resistors
- 2 LEDs, i used a red LED and a Blue LED
- Light Dependent Resistor(LDR)
- A hand full of M-M jumper wires
